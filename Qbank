1. What is a Database?
A database is a collection of information in an organized form for faster and better access, storage and manipulation. It can also be defined as a collection of tables, schema, views and other database objects.
What is Database Testing?
It is back-end testing or data testing.Database testing involves in verifying the integrity of data in the front end with the data present in the back end. It validates the schema, database tables, columns, indexes, stored procedures, triggers, data duplication, orphan records, junk records. It involves in updating records in a database and verifying the same on the front end.

3. What is the difference between GUI Testing and Database Testing?
GUI Testing is AKA User Interface Testing or Front-end testing.Database Testing is AKA back-end testing or data testing.GUI Testing deals with all the testable items that are open to the user to interaction such as Menus, Forms etc.Database Testing deals with all the testable items that are generally hidden from the user.The tester who is performing GUI Testing doesn't need to know Structured Query Language.GUI Testing includes invalidating the text boxes, check boxes, buttons, drop-downs, forms etc., majorly the look and feel of the overall application.Database Testing involves in verifying the integrity of data in the front end with the data present in the back end. It validates the schema, database tables, columns, indexes, stored procedures, triggers, data duplication, orphan records, junk records. It involves in updating records in a database and verifying the same on the front end.
4. What is a Table in a Database?
A table is a database object used to store data in a field in the form of columns and rows that holds the records.
5. What is a Field in a Database?
A field in a Database table is a space allocated to store a particular record within a table.
What is a Record in a Database?
A record (also called a row of data) is an ordered set of related data in a table.
What is a column in a Table?
A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.
8. What is DBMS?
Database Management System is a collection of programs that enables a user to store, retrieve, update and delete information from a database.
9. What is RDBMS?
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model. Data from relational database can be accessed using Structured Query Language (SQL)
What are the popular Database Management Systems in the IT Industry?
Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Sybase, MongoDB, DB2, and Microsoft Access etc.,
11. What is SQL?
SQL Overview: SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is an American National Standard Institute (ANSI) standard. It is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. Using SQL, some of the action we could do are to create databases, tables, stored procedures (SP's), execute queries, retrieve, insert, update, delete data against a database.
12. What are the different types of SQL commands?
SQL commands are segregated into following types: DDL - Data Definition Language
DML- Data Manipulation language
DCL- Data Control Language
13. What are the different DDL commands in SQL?
DDL commands are used to define or alter the structure of the database.CREATE: To create databases and database objects. ALTER: To alter existing database objects.DROP: To drop databases and databases objects.TRUNCATE: To remove all records from a table but not its database structure.RENAME: To rename database objects
14. What are the different DML commands in SQL?
DML commands are used for managing data present in the database.SELECT: To select specific data from a database.INSERT: To insert new records into a table.UPDATE: To update existing records.DELETE: To delete existing records from a table
DCL commands
DCL commands are used to create roles, grant permission and control access to the database objects.GRANT: To provide user access
DENY: To deny permissions to users
REVOKE: To remove user access
17. What is an Index?
An index is used to speed up the performance of queries. It makes faster retrieval of data from the table. The index can be created on one column or a group of columns. Create index_IX tblEmpl_salary on tblEmpl(Salary ASC)
20. What is a Subquery ?
A Subquery is a SQL query within another query. It is a subset of a Select statement whose return values are used in filtering the conditions of the main query.
SELECT *
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY > 4500) ;
How to avoid duplicate records in a query?
The SQL SELECT DISTINCT query is used to return only unique values. It eliminates all the duplicate values.
SQL> SELECT DISTINCT SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS
ORDER BY SALARY;
23. What is the difference between Rename and Alias?
'Rename' is a permanent name given to a table or column.'Alias' is a temporary name given to a table or column.
What is a Join?
Join is a query, which retrieves RELATED columns or rows from multiple tables.
25. What are the different types of joins?
Inner join,Outer Join,Right Join,Left join,
What is the difference between an inner and outer join?
An inner join returns rows when there is at least some matching data between two (or more) tables that are being compared(only shows intersecting data between two table)
An outer join returns rows from both tables that include the records that are matched and unmatched( put it as null value) from one or both the tables.
27. What are SQL constraints?
SQL constraints are the set of rules that enforced some restriction while inserting, deleting or updating of data in the databases.
28. What are the constraints available in SQL?
Some of the constraints in SQL are - Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique Key, SQL Not Null, Default, Check and Index constraint.
29. What is a Unique constraint?
A unique constraint is used to ensure that there are no duplication values in the field/column.
What is a Primary Key?
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a database table.

Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.

A table can have only one primary key, which may consist of single or multiple fields.
Can a table contain multiple PRIMARY KEY's?
No There can only be one primary key in each table.A primary key is a field in a table which uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table. All columns participating in a primary key constraint must not contain NULL values.
What is a Composite PRIMARY KEY?
Composite key, or composite primary key, refers to cases where more than one column is used to specify the primary key of a table. In such cases, all foreign keys will also need to include all the columns in the composite key. Note that the columns that make up a composite key can be of different data types.
